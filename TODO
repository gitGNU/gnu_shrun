* Figure out a way to make stdin, reading from /dev/tty, and su work
  as well as possible.
* Get rid of special open file descriptors in favor of named pipes.
* When the child dies, continue reading from the shell to make sure we
  get all error messages and the like. This will also ensure that we
  properly report exec failures.

* Variable expansion in the output?
* Regular expression comparisons in the output?
* Implement a verbose mode that shows all the output of successful
  commands.
